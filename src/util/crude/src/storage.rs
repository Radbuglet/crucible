/// A storage is a three-way map between [`Entity`] handles, a storage-defined
/// [`Handle`](StorageBase::Handle), and the corresponding [`Component`](StorageBase::Component) value.
///
/// A given entity can be either *missing*, *unhoused*, or *housed*.  A *housed* entity exists in a
/// given [`ArchetypeId`] at the specified `slot` and shows up in calls to [`arch_handles`](StorageBase::arch_handles)
/// and the like. An *unhoused* entity, meanwhile, exists in no archetype and will not show up in
/// any calls to `arch_handles` or the like. However, an unhoused entity still has a `handle` and a
/// `value` associated with it.  Naturally, a *missing* entity is neither present in the archetype
/// table nor does it have a `handle` and `value` associated with it.
///
/// The lifecycle of an entity is as follows:
///
/// - [`insert`](StorageBase::insert) on a *missing* entity associates a handle and value with the
///   entity and makes the entity *unhoused*.
/// - [`reshape`](StorageBase::reshape) on an *unhoused* entity makes the entity *housed*.
/// - [`remove_entity`](StorageBase::remove_entity) on an *unhoused* or *housed* entity makes it
///   *missing*.
///
/// Archetypes among all storages contained in a given [`Universe`](crate::Universe) are expected to
/// all share the same order of entities. We achieve this consistent ordering by ensuring that all
/// archetype reshape operations follow the same algorithm:
///
/// - To remove an entity from an archetype, we swap-remove it from the list.
/// - To add an entity to an archetype, we push it to the end.
