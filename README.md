# Crucible

A work in progress multiplayer voxel game engine to rival... nobody. Made as part of my
 2021-2022 independent study.

## Design

This engine borrows a ton from [Godot](https://godotengine.org/),
 [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Amethyst](https://amethyst.rs/), and the soon(TM) to
 release game [Hytale](https://hytale.com/). The eventual vision for the engine is to
 provide a sandbox where users can publish their games to self-hosted servers, with server
 and client-side plugins implementing all the game's logic.

My top priority right now is to finish the *Arbre* object system, since almost everything
 else depends on it. You can find its current design and progress at `src/arbre/design.md`. 

## License

TBD but certainly something Free.
